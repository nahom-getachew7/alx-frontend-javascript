## Es6 Basics

ECMAScript (ES) is a standardized version of JavaScript, a programming language that is widely used for web development. ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth version of the ECMAScript language specification. It was released in 2015 and is the most recent version of the ECMAScript standard at the moment.

Here are some of the key features of ES6:

let and const: These are new declarations for variables that provide improved control over their scope. let allows you to declare variables with block scope, while const allows you to declare variables that cannot be reassigned.

Arrow functions: These are a concise way to define functions, using the => syntax. They do not have their own this value, so they can be useful for reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed when working with object methods.

Template literals: These are strings that can contain embedded expressions, which are evaluated and included in the string. They are denoted by backticks (`) and can make it easier to build strings that contain dynamic content.

Classes: ES6 introduces a class syntax for defining classes and creating objects. This syntax is similar to that used in other object-oriented programming languages and provides a more structured way to define objects and their behavior.

Modules: ES6 introduces a module system that allows you to define and import code from other files. This can make it easier to organize and maintain your codebase.
