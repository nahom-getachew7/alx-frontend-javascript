### Promise
A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a way that is more readable and easier to manage than using callbacks.


You can then use the Promise by calling .then and passing in a success callback function and an error callback function:

Alternatively, you can use the async/await syntax to make working with Promises more readable

Promises are a powerful and useful tool for working with asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are widely used in modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks, and are an important part of the language's ecosystem.
